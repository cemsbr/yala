## [Unreleased]

## [3.2.0] - 2023-01-30
### Added
- Github actions for automated testing.

### Fixed
- Updated parser for newer Pyflakes versions;
- Updated tests for changes in duplication rule of Pylint.

### Removed
- Support for Python 3.6 (EOL).

## [3.1.0] - 2021-11-15
### Added
- Black Friday is near, so we added Black support! :) Thank you, @viniarck.

### Changed
- Using GitHub actions instead of travis-ci.

## [3.0.0] - 2020-10-23
## Changed
- Pylint's duplicate-code is not disabled anymore, since its parser has multi-line support.
- For yala devs: now, linter parsers receive both stdout and stderr. Reason: isort 5 prints results to stderr.

## Fixed
- Better support for isort 5:
  - No more `--recursive` flag;
  - Its output is now read from stderr instead of stdout.

## Removed
- Python 3.5 support (besides EOL, no isort-5 support)

## [2.2.1] - 2020-04-26
### Fixed
- Multiline results in pylint were not being captured, e.g. bad-whitespace and
  bad-continuation.
- Updated pyflakes output parser: now there's a column number.

### Changed
- Pipfile has Python 3.8 now that it is available in Ubuntu LTS 20.04. However,
  CI still tests under 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7, too.

## [2.2.0] - 2019-11-28
### Added

### Added
- Windows support

## [2.0.0] - 2019-10-10
### Added

### Added
- Radon is back - thanks CartoonFan [#136](https://github.com/cemsbr/yala/issues/136)
